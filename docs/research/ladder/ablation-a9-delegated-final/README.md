# Ablation A9: delegated confirmation of the worker as it ships

Date: 2026-10-09. [A8](../ablation-a8-delegated-lean/README.md) again, with
the agent file in its final form: prompt v4, `excludeTools: contact_supervisor`
restored, no `thinking:`, `allowedAgents:`, or `defaultContext:` lines, guards
at their default (nudge cap 3, loop breaker live), no parent-side skill.

```bash
uv run python -m ladder.run_ladder --mode delegated --profile baseline --guards --rung 1 --rung 2 --rung 3 --rung 4 --rung 5 --repeat 3 --deadline 900 --out docs/research/ladder/ablation-a9-delegated-final
```

## The failure

Rung 4 r3: the child edited `totals.py`, then its next turn was empty
(`stopReason: stop`, text `"\n\n"`). pi-subagents ended the run with
"Subagent produced no output". The parent re-dispatched; the second child
read three files and went empty again after three tool calls. The parent
then stopped, reported "blocked (mellum-worker lane failing)" with the
partial diff and both run ids, and did not claim success. That is the
correct parent behaviour and the honest failure of the night.

## The finding: the nudge does not fire inside a delegated child

In direct mode the nudge recovered every empty turn in phase 2b (seven of
seven). In sixty delegated runs (3a, 3b, A8, A9) the child's `nudges`
column is zero while eleven runs contain pi-subagents' "produced no
output" error, which is exactly the empty turn. The child's request trace
for rung 4 r3 shows the run ending at the empty turn with no continuation
request. pi-subagents ends a child run on an empty terminal assistant
message before an `agent_before_settle` continuation can act, or does not
forward that hook to children at all; the source has no reference to it.

So in the delegated recipe the recovery is the *parent's* re-dispatch,
which worked in nine of the eleven occurrences (58/60 passes across the
four delegated phases), not the extension's nudge. The extension's nudge
is a direct-mode guard. Making the empty turn recoverable inside the child
under pi-subagents is the first item on the backlog; until then the
worker's description should tell the parent what the skill used to:
re-dispatch once on "produced no output".

**Decision:** the worker ships as measured here. 14/15 is within one of
the reference and the one failure is the known pathology with the parent
behaving correctly.
