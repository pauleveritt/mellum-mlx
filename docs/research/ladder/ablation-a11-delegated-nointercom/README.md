# Ablation A11: pi-subagents' intercom bridge off

Date: 2026-10-09. [A10](../ablation-a10-delegated-v5/README.md) again with
pi-subagents' `intercomBridge.mode` set to `off`. pi-subagents reads that
only from `~/.pi/agent/extensions/subagent/config.json`; the runner's new
`--subagents-config` writes a replacement into the mirrored agent directory
so the operator's file is untouched. The setting removes the 1,582-character
"Intercom orchestration channel" block that every child otherwise receives,
which told the worker to use a `contact_supervisor` tool it does not have.

```bash
uv run python -m ladder.run_ladder --mode delegated --profile baseline --guards --subagents-config '{"intercomBridge":{"mode":"off"}}' --rung 1 --rung 2 --rung 3 --rung 4 --rung 5 --repeat 3 --deadline 900 --out docs/research/ladder/ablation-a11-delegated-nointercom

## Reading

**Holds, and the child's prompt is 55% smaller.** The 20% drop in prefill
is the block's share of every request. Passes, requests and errors did not
move. Wall time did not move either: prefill on oMLX is mostly cache hits
(86% of the direct worker's input tokens in A3), so a shorter prompt is
cheaper in tokens, not noticeably in seconds.

**The empty turn came back, twice, and the parent recovered both.** A10's
zero was luck at n = 15; across the five delegated phases the rate is 2–3
runs in 15. The parent's re-dispatch remains the recovery in delegated
mode, now 12 of 13 occurrences.

**What the setting costs.** It is global: with the bridge off, none of the
operator's subagents get `contact_supervisor` or its instructions. For a
profile whose children are all leaf workers that is free; for one that uses
supervisor messaging it is not. The recipe lists it as an optional
operator setting with that caveat, not a default.

**The remaining 521 characters** are pi-subagents' child preamble ("You are
a child subagent, not the parent orchestrator…"), which has no switch. The
worker's own prompt is now just over half of what the model reads before
the task.
