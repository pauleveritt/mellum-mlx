# Phase 1: tuned profile, worker prompt v3

Date: 2026-10-08. Same launch, rungs, repeats, and prompt (v3) as
[phase 0b](../phase0b-baseline-v3/README.md); only the oMLX profile changed.

| setting | baseline | tuned |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_tokens` | 4,096 | 16,384 |
| `thinking_budget_enabled` / `_tokens` | off | on / 4,096 |
| `presence_penalty` | 0 | 0.5 |
| `max_tool_result_tokens` | unset | 4,000 |
| `chat_template_kwargs` / `forced_ct_kwargs` | unset | `{"enable_thinking": true}` / `["enable_thinking"]` |

The runner applied the profile through the admin API and verified the live
values before the first run; `versions.model_settings` in each `run.json`
records them. The profile was restored to baseline afterwards.

Command:

```bash
uv run python -m ladder.run_ladder --profile tuned --rung 1 --rung 2 --rung 3 --rung 4 --rung 5 --repeat 3 --deadline 600 --out docs/research/ladder/phase1-tuned-v3
```

## Result

| 2 | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| 3 | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| 4 | 3/3 | 2/3 |
| 5 | 3/3 | 2/3 |

13 of 15 against 15 of 15. Full columns in [table.md](table.md).

| measure (15 runs) | baseline | tuned |

## Reading

**The tuned profile bought nothing the ladder can see and may have cost two
runs.** Both tuned failures (4 r1, 5 r3) are the empty-final stop: a partial
edit, a read, then `stopReason: stop` with no visible text — the same
pathology as the baseline's single empty final (3 r3, which happened to pass
because the work was already done). Three repeats cannot separate 13/15 from
15/15 with confidence; what they can say is that the profile did not rescue
anything, because there was nothing left to rescue after prompt v3.

What each setting did or did not do:

- **Thinking budget.** Never triggered a re-entry; no run died inside
  thinking on either profile (every stop reason is `stop`). On the baseline
  profile the 4,096 output cap was also never hit in 15 runs. On these tasks
  the budget is insurance, not a fix.
- **16,384 output.** Unused headroom on these rungs.
- **`max_tool_result_tokens` 4,000.** Largest prompts were smaller
  (52k vs 76k chars), consistent with truncated tool results, with no
  effect on pass/fail.
- **Presence penalty 0.5.** The one setting with a plausible mechanism for
  *earlier* stops: it penalises every token already in the context,
  including tool-call scaffolding. Isolated in the variant below.

## Clamp check

With the tuned profile live, a chat request with `max_tokens: 20000` returned
HTTP 200, `finish_reason: stop` — oMLX clamps to the profile's cap rather than
rejecting, so the harness limits can stay at 16,384 regardless of profile.

## Variant: tuned without the penalty

See `../phase1b-tuned-nopenalty-v3/` — the same tuned profile with
`presence_penalty` 0, run to attribute the two failures.

## First attempt discarded

A first phase-1 launch recorded two 600 s deadline rows with zero provider
requests: Pi hung before its first request because the runner was started
at the tail of a compound shell command and inherited a stdin pipe that
never closed. The runner now passes `stdin=DEVNULL` (test
`test_run_once_never_inherits_stdin`); those rows carried no model evidence
and were deleted.

### Variant result

| rung | baseline | tuned | tuned, no penalty |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3/3 | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| 2 | 3/3 | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| 3 | 3/3 | 3/3 | 2/3 |
| 4 | 3/3 | 2/3 | 1/3 |
| 5 | 3/3 | 2/3 | 3/3 |
| empty finals | 1 | 2 | 4 |
| mean requests | 14.3 | 15.1 | 11.7 |
| edit anchor failures | 5 | 7 | 0 |

12 of 15 without the penalty. The presence penalty is not the cause of the
tuned failures. Every failure across the three profiles (5 of 45 runs) is
the same event — a turn ending with `stopReason: stop` and no visible text,
part-way through the task — and its count per profile (1, 2, 4) is within
what three repeats produce by chance. **Conclusion: on these rungs the
server profile neither helps nor hurts; the empty-final stop is a model
behaviour independent of output cap, thinking budget, tool-result cap, and
presence penalty.** It is the phase-2 target.

The 16k output and the thinking budget remain reasonable insurance for
larger tasks than these fixtures; the ladder has no evidence either way at
that size.
