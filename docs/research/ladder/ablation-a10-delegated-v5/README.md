# Ablation A10: delegated confirmation of the worker as it ships (prompt v5)

Date: 2026-10-09. [A9](../ablation-a9-delegated-final/README.md) again after
the review pass: prompt v5 (the test-command facts and the missing-files
line, 643 characters), the guard extension at `.pi/mellum/` with the
corrected loop breaker and the stop-reason-gated nudge, the final
frontmatter. This is the file in the repository, unchanged.

```bash
uv run python -m ladder.run_ladder --mode delegated --profile baseline --guards --rung 1 --rung 2 --rung 3 --rung 4 --rung 5 --repeat 3 --deadline 900 --out docs/research/ladder/ablation-a10-delegated-v5
```

## Reading

The worker as it ships passes the delegated ladder 15/15 with no
re-dispatch and no empty child turn, at 61% of the original prompt's
length and with the Pi-side configuration that phase 3 started from minus
four frontmatter lines, the skill, and the tool descriptions. The empty
turn did not occur this time; it occurred in 3 of 15 runs in 3a and A9
each, so its absence here is luck at n = 15, not a property of v5. The
recovery for it in delegated mode remains the parent's re-dispatch.

This closes the lean-down: [ablation-summary.md](../ablation-summary.md).
